This project implements a framework for assessing insurance purchasing decisions and helps optimize insurance retentions and limits for businesses using ergodic theory (time-average) rather than traditional ensemble approaches. The framework aims to demonstrate how insurance transforms from a cost center to a growth enabler when analyzed through time averages.

The model is intended to be used with public financial data to model a real business, simulate an insurance market cycle, and optimize long-term business growth by selecting the right risk management strategy.

## Key Objectives
1. Build a complete simulation framework for ergodic insurance optimization
2. Generate compelling evidence for blog posts demonstrating ergodic advantages
3. Provide actuaries, CFOs, and risk managers with practical Python tools for insurance decision-making
4. Validate that optimal insurance premiums can exceed expected losses by 200-500% while enhancing growth

Primary Language: Python 3.12+
Version Control: Never commit directly to main branch - use feature branches
Code Quality: Run formatters and linters before committing

## Git Configuration

- **Repository**: https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/Ergodic-Insurance-Limits

You have access to the `log_activity` tool. Use it to record your activities after every activity that is relevant for the project. This helps track development progress and understand what has been done.

## When Starting Work
1. Review this file and the sprint documents in `simone/`
2. Check current git status and recent commits
3. Run tests to ensure everything is working
4. Check the todo items in sprint documents for next tasks
5. Use the TodoWrite tool to track your work progress

## Documentation Layout
The documentation is split between three parts:
- "ergodic_insurance\docs\tutorials\" which has the tutorials on specific important features.
- "ergodic_insurance\docs\user_guide\" which has the Quick Start guide and a general overview of the project.
- "ergodic_insurance\notebooks\" which provides specific and comprehensive examples of how to use the code.
