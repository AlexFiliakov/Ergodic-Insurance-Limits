# Insurance Layer Structure
layers:
  # Primary Layer (Working layer with frequent claims)
  primary:
    attachment_point: 0
    limit: 5_000_000
    rate_on_line: 0.02  # 2.0% rate on line
    description: "Working layer covering most attritional and some large losses"

  # First Excess Layer (Middle market layer)
  first_excess:
    attachment_point: 5_000_000
    limit: 20_000_000  # $5M to $25M coverage
    rate_on_line: 0.01  # 1.0% rate on line
    description: "Middle market layer for large losses"

  # Second Excess Layer (High excess layer)
  second_excess:
    attachment_point: 25_000_000
    limit: 75_000_000  # $25M to $100M coverage
    rate_on_line: 0.005  # 0.5% rate on line
    description: "High excess layer for severe events"

  # Third Excess Layer (Catastrophic layer)
  third_excess:
    attachment_point: 100_000_000
    limit: 150_000_000  # $100M to $250M coverage
    rate_on_line: 0.003  # 0.3% rate on line
    description: "Catastrophic layer for extreme tail events"

# Deductible Options (Self-Insured Retention)
deductibles:
  - 1_000_000   # $1M deductible
  - 2_000_000   # $2M deductible
  - 5_000_000   # $5M deductible
  - 10_000_000  # $10M deductible
  - 25_000_000  # $25M deductible

# Premium Calculation Notes
premium_notes: |
  Premium = Σ (Layer Limit × Rate on Line) for selected layers

  Example for full coverage with $1M deductible:
  - Primary (above $1M): $4M × 2.0% = $80K
  - First Excess: $20M × 1.0% = $200K
  - Second Excess: $75M × 0.5% = $375K
  - Third Excess: $150M × 0.3% = $450K
  - Total Annual Premium: $1,105K

  Decreasing rates reflect lower expected frequency at higher layers,
  though ergodic value of high-layer coverage exceeds loss-cost analysis.
