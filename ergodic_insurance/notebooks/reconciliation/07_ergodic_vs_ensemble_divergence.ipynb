    "# Reconciliation #07: Ergodic vs Ensemble Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **What this notebook tests:** Time-average and ensemble-average growth rates diverge under volatility (the core thesis of ergodic economics), and insurance narrows this gap by reducing volatility drag.\n",
    "- **Prerequisites:** `pip install ergodic-insurance`\n",
    "- **Estimated runtime:** < 60 seconds\n",
    "- **Audience:** Developers, actuaries, and risk managers verifying the ergodic economics framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checks Performed\n",
    "1. **Non-ergodicity:** Ensemble average exceeds time average in both insured and uninsured scenarios.\n",
    "2. **Insurance reduces ergodic gap:** `gap(uninsured) > gap(insured)` -- insurance narrows the divergence.\n",
    "3. **Insurance enhances time-average growth:** `time_avg(insured) > time_avg(uninsured)`.\n",
    "4. **Statistical significance:** Bootstrap confidence interval on the growth rate difference is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "We run Monte Carlo paths for two scenarios (uninsured and insured), compute ensemble-average and time-average growth rates for each, and verify the core ergodic divergence relationships. A bootstrap test confirms the growth rate improvement is statistically significant."
