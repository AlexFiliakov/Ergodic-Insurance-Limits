2. **Walk-Forward Validation** (#54) - Complete rolling window validation system
3. **Statistical Testing Framework** (#53) - Comprehensive hypothesis testing
4. **Test Quality Improvements** (#93) - Phase 1 & 2 completed, Phase 3 pending
5. **Documentation Updates** - All new modules documented with Google-style docstrings
6. **Bug Fixes** - Fixed pylint/mypy issues, test warnings, visualization bugs

### Outstanding Issues from Sprint 06
- **Issue #95**: Phase 3 test improvements (mocking reduction) - Deferred to Sprint 07d

## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Test Quality Gaps (HIGH PRIORITY)
Despite 100% coverage, significant quality issues remain:
- **Skipped Tests**: 16 performance tests marked as skip
- **Weak Assertions**: ~30% of tests use weak patterns (e.g., `assert x is not None`)
- **Over-Mocking**: ~25% of tests mock core functionality
- **Platform Dependencies**: Some tests skip on Windows

**Impact**: Real confidence level is ~60-70% despite 100% coverage metric.

### 2. Performance Test Timeouts
Performance tests are causing timeouts (>2 minutes) when run. This suggests:
- Tests may be running without proper markers
- Slow tests not properly isolated
- Possible infinite loops or excessive iterations

### 3. Incomplete Sprint 07 Issue Creation
Sprint 07 is referenced in the plan but most issues aren't created in GitHub:
- Only Sprint 07a-d sub-issues exist (60-70, 90, 95)
- Main Sprint 07 visualization tasks not tracked
- Missing clear acceptance criteria for reporting phase

## Hotfixes Required Before Sprint 07

### Priority 1: Immediate (Must Fix)
```python
# 1. Fix performance test markers and timeouts
@pytest.mark.slow
@pytest.mark.performance
@pytest.mark.timeout(30)  # Add explicit timeouts

# 2. Enable skipped tests with proper markers
pytest -m "not slow"  # Normal runs
pytest -m slow       # CI/nightly runs

# 3. Fix weak assertions in visualization tests
# Before: assert fig is not None
# After: Validate actual plot content and data
```

### Priority 2: Important (Should Fix)
- Reduce mocking in integration tests
- Add property-based testing for mathematical components
- Implement snapshot testing for visualizations
- Create comprehensive end-to-end scenario tests

### Priority 3: Nice to Have (Could Fix)
- Improve test documentation
- Add performance regression detection
- Create test data fixtures
- Implement mutation testing

## Sprint 07 Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed
- Core Monte Carlo engine is functional
- Performance targets achieved
- Statistical frameworks in place
- Memory management optimized

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks for Sprint 07
1. **Visualization Dependencies**: Weak test coverage may cause runtime failures
2. **Report Generation**: No existing report infrastructure
3. **Data Caching**: HDF5/Parquet caching system not implemented
4. **Executive vs Technical**: Dual-track reporting not clearly defined

### üîß Recommended Pre-Sprint 07 Actions

#### Day 1: Test Infrastructure (4 hours)
1. Fix performance test timeouts
2. Enable and mark slow tests appropriately
3. Strengthen 10 critical visualization test assertions
4. Run full test suite to verify stability

#### Day 2: Sprint Planning (4 hours)
1. Create detailed Sprint 07 GitHub issues
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each visualization
3. Set up visualization factory structure
4. Design caching architecture

## Sprint 07 Implementation Strategy

### Phase Structure
1. **Sprint 07a**: Core Visualization Infrastructure (Week 1)
   - Build visualization factory
   - Implement caching system
   - Create style templates

2. **Sprint 07b**: Executive Visualizations (Week 1-2)
   - ROE-Ruin frontier
   - Ruin cliff visualization
   - Premium multiplier analysis
   - Break-even timelines

3. **Sprint 07c**: Technical Appendix (Week 2)
   - Convergence diagnostics
   - Path-dependent evolution
   - Premium decomposition
   - Capital efficiency surfaces

4. **Sprint 07d**: Report Generation (Week 2-3)
   - Automated compilation
   - Table generation
   - Scenario comparison
   - Excel export (#90)

## Quality Gates for Sprint 07

1. **Visualization Tests**: Each plot must have >5 meaningful assertions
2. **Performance**: Report generation <30 seconds for standard scenarios
3. **Caching**: 10x speedup on second run
4. **Documentation**: Each visualization must have usage examples
5. **Reproducibility**: Identical outputs for same seeds

## Risk Mitigation Plan

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Visualization failures | Medium | High | Strengthen tests before starting |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Implement caching early |
| Memory issues with plots | Medium | Medium | Use figure cleanup and limits |
| Report generation bugs | High | High | Build incrementally with validation |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. [ ] Fix performance test timeouts
2. [ ] Create Sprint 07 epic with sub-issues
3. [ ] Strengthen 10 critical test assertions
4. [ ] Set up basic visualization factory structure

### Short-term (Next 48 Hours)
1. [ ] Implement caching system design
2. [ ] Create visualization style guide
3. [ ] Build first executive visualization (ROE-Ruin)
4. [ ] Add end-to-end integration test

### Week 1 Targets
1. [ ] Complete Sprint 07a infrastructure
2. [ ] Deliver 3 executive visualizations
3. [ ] Achieve caching system functionality
4. [ ] Maintain test coverage >85%

## Conclusion

Sprint 06 has successfully delivered the Monte Carlo engine with excellent performance characteristics. However, test quality issues discovered during the sprint review pose risks for Sprint 07's visualization-heavy workload.

**Recommendation**: Spend 1-2 days on test quality improvements and Sprint 07 planning before proceeding with visualization implementation. This investment will prevent downstream issues and ensure robust report generation.

### Overall Sprint 06 Rating: **8.5/10**
- ‚úÖ All features delivered
- ‚úÖ Performance targets met
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test quality needs improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some technical debt accumulated

### Sprint 07 Go/No-Go: **GO WITH CONDITIONS**
- Proceed after completing Priority 1 hotfixes
- Allocate extra time for test improvements
- Consider reducing Sprint 07 scope if needed
