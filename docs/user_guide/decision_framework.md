# Decision Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach to making optimal insurance decisions using ergodic theory. Unlike traditional methods that focus on minimizing costs, this framework optimizes for long-term growth while managing risk.

## The Five-Step Decision Process

### Step 1: Define Your Business Parameters

**Key Inputs:**
- Current assets and revenue
- Operating margins and growth rate
- Risk tolerance and time horizon
- Cash flow requirements

**Critical Questions:**
- What is your business's natural volatility?
- How much capital is at risk?
- What is your minimum viable operating level?

### Step 2: Quantify Your Risk Exposure

**Risk Categories:**
- **Operational Risks**: Equipment failure, supply chain disruption
- **Liability Risks**: Product liability, professional errors
- **Property Risks**: Fire, flood, natural disasters
- **Financial Risks**: Credit losses, market volatility

**Risk Metrics:**
- Frequency: How often do losses occur?
- Severity: How large are typical losses?
- Correlation: Do losses cluster together?
- Tail risk: What are worst-case scenarios?

### Step 3: Evaluate Insurance Options

**Coverage Dimensions:**
- **Limits**: Maximum payout per claim
- **Attachments**: Deductible or self-insured retention
- **Premiums**: Annual cost as % of limit
- **Terms**: Aggregate limits, exclusions, conditions

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Time-average growth impact
- Probability of ruin reduction
- Cash flow stability
- Return on premium investment

### Step 4: Run Ergodic Analysis

**Simulation Parameters:**
```python
# Define scenarios
scenarios = {
    'conservative': {'n_simulations': 10000, 'time_horizon': 30},
    'base': {'n_simulations': 5000, 'time_horizon': 20},
    'aggressive': {'n_simulations': 1000, 'time_horizon': 10}
}

# Key metrics to evaluate
metrics = [
    'time_average_growth',
    'ensemble_average_growth',
    'probability_of_ruin',
    'volatility_reduction',
    'worst_case_outcome'
]
```

**Interpretation Guide:**
- **Growth Rate Differential**: Ergodic vs ensemble averages
- **Risk-Return Trade-off**: Growth vs volatility
- **Tail Risk Protection**: 95th and 99th percentile outcomes

### Step 5: Make the Optimal Decision

**Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| High Growth > Low Risk | Increase limits | Protect growth trajectory |
| High Growth = High Risk | Layer coverage | Balance cost and protection |
| Low Growth > High Risk | Focus on retention | Minimize ruin probability |
| Low Growth = Low Risk | Basic coverage | Optimize cost efficiency |

## Decision Trees

### For Manufacturing Companies

```
Start: Annual Revenue > $50M?
├─ Yes: Consider $25M+ limits
│   ├─ Margin > 10%: Full coverage recommended
│   └─ Margin < 10%: Focus on catastrophic only
└─ No: Consider $5-10M limits
    ├─ High volatility: Layer with low attachment
    └─ Low volatility: Higher attachment acceptable
```

### For Technology Companies

```
Start: Funding Stage?
├─ Seed/Series A: Minimize premium, basic coverage
├─ Series B/C: Balance growth and protection
└─ Late Stage/Public: Comprehensive program
    ├─ High burn rate: Prioritize D&O and E&O
    └─ Profitable: Full operational coverage
```

## Key Decision Principles

### 1. The Volatility Principle
**Higher volatility requires lower attachment points**

$$\text{Optimal Attachment} = \max(0, \text{Assets} \times (1 - 2\sigma))$$

Where $\sigma$ is annual volatility.

### 2. The Growth Principle
**Higher growth justifies higher premiums**

$$\text{Max Premium} = \text{Growth Rate} \times \text{Assets} \times 0.15$$

### 3. The Ruin Principle
**Never accept > 5% ruin probability over planning horizon**

$$P(\text{Ruin}) < 0.05 \text{ over } T \text{ years}$$

## Common Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Startup with Limited Capital

**Situation:**
- $2M assets, 40% annual growth
- High volatility (30-40%)
- Limited cash for premiums

**Recommended Decision:**
- Focus on catastrophic coverage only
- $5M limit with $500K attachment
- Accept higher operational risk
- Revisit after next funding round

### Scenario 2: Mature Manufacturer

**Situation:**
- $50M assets, 5% annual growth
- Moderate volatility (15%)
- Strong cash position

**Recommended Decision:**
- Comprehensive multi-layer program
- $100M total limits
- Low attachment for predictability
- Annual premium 1-2% of assets

### Scenario 3: High-Risk Industry

**Situation:**
- Chemical manufacturing
- High severity potential
- Regulatory requirements

**Recommended Decision:**
- Maximum available limits
- Multiple excess layers
- Environmental coverage
- Premium 3-5% of assets acceptable

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Decision
- [ ] Gather 3 years of loss history
- [ ] Calculate business volatility
- [ ] Define risk tolerance
- [ ] Set growth targets

### Analysis
- [ ] Run base case simulation
- [ ] Test sensitivity to parameters
- [ ] Compare 3+ insurance options
- [ ] Calculate ergodic metrics

### Decision
- [ ] Select optimal structure
- [ ] Document reasoning
- [ ] Set review triggers
- [ ] Plan implementation

### Post-Decision
- [ ] Monitor actual vs expected
- [ ] Track key metrics quarterly
- [ ] Adjust for material changes
- [ ] Annual strategy review

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Optimizing for premium cost alone** - Ignores growth impact
2. **Using only expected value analysis** - Misses ergodic effects
3. **Under-insuring tail risks** - Catastrophic for long-term growth
4. **Over-insuring predictable losses** - Inefficient capital use
5. **Ignoring correlation between risks** - Underestimates aggregate exposure
