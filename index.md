# Ergodic Insurance Limits

A revolutionary framework for optimizing insurance limits using ergodic (time-average) theory.

### Key Formula

The time-average growth rate with insurance:

$$g = \lim_{T\to\infty}{\frac{1}{T}\ln{\frac{x(T)}{x(0)}}}$$

This framework resolves the fundamental insurance puzzle: while insurance appears zero-sum in expected value terms, both parties benefit when optimizing time-average growth rates.
