Insurance Terms
---------------

**Attachment Point**
   The loss level at which an insurance layer begins to pay. For example, a layer with a $1M attachment point starts paying after the first $1M of loss.

**Burning Cost**
   Historical average losses as a percentage of limit. Used as a baseline for pricing.

**Captive Insurance Company**
   A subsidiary company created to provide insurance to its parent company. Allows for risk retention with potential tax benefits.

**Catastrophe (Cat) Coverage**
   Insurance for low-frequency, high-severity events like natural disasters or major accidents.

**Ceded Premium**
   The portion of premium passed to reinsurers when risk is transferred.

**Deductible**
   See Retention.

**Excess Insurance**
   Coverage that applies above a primary layer. Only pays after underlying limits are exhausted.

**Experience Rating**
   Premium adjustment based on your company's actual loss history.

**Frequency**
   The expected number of loss events per year. Typically modeled with Poisson distribution.

**IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported)**
   Losses that have occurred but haven't been reported yet. Important for reserving.

**Layer**
   A horizontal slice of insurance coverage between two dollar amounts.

**Limit**
   The maximum amount an insurer will pay under a policy.

**Loading Factor**
   The multiple applied to expected losses to determine premium. Includes insurer profit and expenses.

**Parametric Insurance**
   Insurance that pays based on objective triggers (e.g., earthquake magnitude) rather than actual losses.

**Premium**
   The amount paid for insurance coverage, typically annual.

**Primary Insurance**
   The first layer of insurance coverage, sits above the retention.

**Retention (or Deductible)**
   The amount of loss you retain before insurance responds. Also called self-insured retention (SIR).

**Severity**
   The size of a loss when it occurs. Often modeled with lognormal distribution.

**Tower**
   The complete stack of insurance layers from retention to maximum limit.

**Umbrella Coverage**
   Broad coverage that sits above multiple underlying policies.

Mathematical Terms
------------------

**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
   Standard deviation divided by mean. Measures relative variability.

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**
   Expected loss given that loss exceeds VaR threshold. Also called Expected Shortfall.

**Correlation**
   Statistical relationship between two variables. Range from -1 to +1.

**Ensemble Average**
   Average across many parallel scenarios at a single point in time.

**Ergodic**
   A system where time averages equal ensemble averages. Most economic systems are non-ergodic.

**Expected Value**
   Probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes.

**Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
   Stochastic process used to model asset prices with continuous random changes.

**Kelly Criterion**
   Formula for optimal bet sizing that maximizes long-term growth rate.

**Lognormal Distribution**
   Probability distribution where the logarithm is normally distributed. Common for modeling losses.

**Maximum Drawdown**
   Largest peak-to-trough decline in wealth over a period.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**
   Method using random sampling to model probability distributions.

**Poisson Process**
   Statistical model for counting random events over time. Used for loss frequency.

**Power Law Distribution**
   Heavy-tailed distribution where extreme events are more likely than in normal distribution.

**Ruin Probability**
   Probability that wealth reaches zero at any point.

**Sharpe Ratio**
   Risk-adjusted return measure: (return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation.

**Sortino Ratio**
   Like Sharpe ratio but only considers downside volatility.

**Stochastic Process**
   Random process that evolves over time.

**Time Average**
   Average of a single trajectory over time. What an individual entity actually experiences.

**Value at Risk (VaR)**
   Loss level that won't be exceeded with specified confidence (e.g., 95% VaR).

**Volatility**
   Standard deviation of returns, measures uncertainty.

Business Terms
--------------

**Assets**
   Total resources owned by the company. Basis for many insurance calculations.

**Base Revenue**
   Starting annual revenue before growth or shocks.

**Burn Rate**
   Rate at which a company spends cash, especially relevant for startups.

**CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**
   Investments in long-term assets like equipment or facilities.

**Cash Flow**
   Actual cash generated or consumed by operations.

**Debt Capacity**
   Maximum borrowing ability, often expressed as percentage of assets.

**Dividend Rate**
   Percentage of profits distributed to shareholders.

**EBITDA**
   Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

**Growth Rate**
   Annual percentage increase in revenue or assets.

**Margin**
   Profit as percentage of revenue. Operating margin excludes financing costs.

**Operating Leverage**
   Degree to which costs are fixed vs. variable. High leverage means profits vary more with revenue.

**Return on Assets (ROA)**
   Net income divided by total assets.

**Return on Equity (ROE)**
   Net income divided by shareholder equity.

**Terminal Value**
   Value at the end of the analysis period.

**Working Capital**
   Current assets minus current liabilities. Cash tied up in operations.

Ergodic Framework Terms
------------------------

**Ergodic Gap**
   Difference between ensemble average and time average growth rates.

**Ergodic Insurance Premium**
   Maximum premium where insurance still improves time-average growth.

**Ergodic Optimization**
   Maximizing time-average growth rate rather than expected value.

**Ergodic Value**
   Long-term wealth achieved through time-average optimization.

**Growth-Optimal Strategy**
   Strategy that maximizes long-term time-average growth rate.

**Multiplicative Dynamics**
   Processes where outcomes multiply rather than add (e.g., wealth growth).

**Non-Ergodic System**
   System where time and ensemble averages differ. Includes most economic systems.

**Survival Constraint**
   Requirement to avoid ruin before optimizing for growth.

**Time Horizon**
   Period over which analysis is performed. Longer horizons reveal ergodic effects.

**Wealth Multiple**
   Final wealth divided by starting wealth.

Simulation Parameters
---------------------

   Range containing true value with specified probability.

**Convergence**
   When simulation results stabilize with additional iterations.
