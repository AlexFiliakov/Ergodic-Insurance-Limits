# Conservative Configuration for Ergodic Insurance Model
# Risk-averse parameters with lower growth and higher safety margins

# Define common conservative values as anchors
_conservative_anchors:
  low_growth: &low_growth 0.03           # 3% annual growth
  low_margin: &low_margin 0.06           # 6% operating margin
  high_working_capital: &high_wc 0.25    # 25% of sales in WC
  low_retention: &low_retention 0.8      # 80% retention (20% dividends)
  high_min_cash: &high_min_cash 500_000  # $500k minimum cash
