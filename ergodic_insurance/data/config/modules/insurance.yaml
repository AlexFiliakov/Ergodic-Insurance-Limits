      Market Premium = Pure Premium / Loss Ratio

      Where:
      - Pure Premium = Expected Frequency × Expected Severity
      - Loss Ratio varies by market cycle (60% hard, 70% normal, 80% soft)
      - Technical Premium = Pure Premium × (1 + Expenses + Profit + Risk Loading)
      - Final Premium = max(Technical Premium / Loss Ratio, Minimum Premium)
