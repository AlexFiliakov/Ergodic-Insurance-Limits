# Sprint 1: Foundation - Financial Model Implementation

## Sprint Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Goal**: Build core financial modeling infrastructure for widget manufacturer with long-term simulation capabilities  
**Key Outcome**: Deterministic financial model capable of simulating up to 1000 years with monthly/annual resolution

## Sprint Objectives

1. Establish Python project structure with test-driven development
2. Create configurable financial model for generic widget manufacturer
3. Implement time series evolution with monthly and annual resolution options
4. Build debt financing mechanism for unpaid insurance claims
5. Develop exploration notebooks demonstrating model capabilities

## Technical Decisions

### Time Resolution Strategy
- **Primary**: Annual resolution for long-term (100-1000 year) simulations
- **Secondary**: Monthly resolution for detailed short-term (1-10 year) analysis
- **Rationale**: Monthly × 1000 years = 12,000 periods (computationally intensive for initial development)
- **Implementation**: Abstract time-step interface allowing both resolutions

### Financial Model Scope
- Focus on financial aggregates (no detailed inventory/receivables)
- Debt only for claim collateral (no leverage for growth)
- No depreciation or complex tax strategies
- Deterministic growth and costs (stochastic in later sprints)

## User Stories & Tasks

### Story 1: Project Infrastructure
**As a** developer  
**I want** a well-structured Python project with testing framework  
**So that** we can maintain code quality throughout development

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Python package structure (`ergodic_insurance/`)
- [ ] Set up pytest testing framework with coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, pylint, mypy)
- [ ] Create requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [ ] Write setup.py for package installation
- [ ] Initialize git repository with .gitignore

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Package installable via `pip install -e .`
- Tests runnable via `pytest` with coverage report
- Code formatting automated via pre-commit

### Story 2: Configuration Management
**As a** user  
**I want** to configure financial parameters via YAML  
**So that** I can easily run different scenarios

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `ergodic_insurance/data/parameters/baseline.yaml` with default parameters
- [ ] Implement configuration loader with validation
- [ ] Define parameter schema with pydantic models
- [ ] Create parameter override mechanism
- [ ] Write tests for configuration validation

**baseline.yaml structure**:
```yaml
manufacturer:
  initial_assets: 10_000_000  # $10M starting assets
  asset_turnover_ratio: 1.0    # Revenue per dollar of assets
  operating_margin: 0.08        # 8% operating profit margin
  tax_rate: 0.25               # 25% corporate tax rate
  retention_ratio: 1.0         # 100% earnings retention (no dividends)
  
working_capital:
  percent_of_sales: 0.20       # 20% of sales tied up in working capital
  
growth:
  type: "deterministic"        # vs "stochastic" in future
  annual_growth_rate: 0.05     # 5% baseline growth
  
simulation:
  time_resolution: "annual"    # or "monthly"
  time_horizon_years: 100      # Default horizon
  max_horizon_years: 1000      # Maximum supported
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- YAML loads correctly with type validation
- Invalid parameters raise clear errors
- Parameter override works programmatically

### Story 3: Core Financial Model
**As an** actuary  
**I want** a widget manufacturer financial model  
**So that** I can simulate business performance over time

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `WidgetManufacturer` class with financial state
- [ ] Implement asset-driven revenue generation
- [ ] Model operating costs and margins
- [ ] Calculate taxes and net income
- [ ] Implement retained earnings and asset growth
- [ ] Track key metrics (ROE, asset turnover, etc.)
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests

**Core Model Components**:
```python
class WidgetManufacturer:
    def __init__(self, config: ManufacturerConfig):
        self.assets = config.initial_assets
        self.debt = 0  # Only for claims
        self.equity = self.assets
        
    def calculate_revenue(self) -> float:
        """Revenue = Assets × Asset Turnover Ratio"""
        
    def calculate_operating_income(self) -> float:
        """Operating Income = Revenue × Operating Margin"""
        
    def calculate_net_income(self) -> float:
        """Net Income = (Operating Income - Interest) × (1 - Tax Rate)"""
        
    def update_balance_sheet(self, net_income: float):
        """Assets grow by retained earnings"""
        
    def calculate_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """ROE, ROA, Debt-to-Equity, etc."""
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Model correctly calculates all financial flows
- Balance sheet remains balanced after updates
- ROE calculation matches standard formula
- 95% test coverage for financial calculations

### Story 4: Time Series Evolution
**As a** researcher  
**I want** to simulate manufacturer finances over long time periods  
**So that** I can study ergodic properties

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `Simulation` class for time evolution
- [ ] Implement annual step function
- [ ] Implement monthly step function with annual aggregation
- [ ] Add state history tracking (memory efficient for 1000 years)
- [ ] Create metric calculation at each time step
- [ ] Implement results aggregation and export
- [ ] Write tests for long-term stability

**Simulation Features**:
```python
class Simulation:
    def __init__(self, manufacturer: WidgetManufacturer, config: SimulationConfig):
        self.time_resolution = config.time_resolution
        self.horizon_years = config.time_horizon_years
        
    def run(self) -> SimulationResults:
        """Execute simulation for specified horizon"""
        
    def step_annual(self) -> None:
        """Single annual time step"""
        
    def step_monthly(self) -> None:
        """Single monthly time step"""
        
    def get_trajectory(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Return time series of key metrics"""
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Simulation runs for 1000 years without numerical issues
- Monthly and annual resolutions produce consistent results
- Memory usage remains reasonable for long simulations
- Results exportable to pandas DataFrame

### Story 5: Debt Financing for Claims
**As a** risk manager  
**I want** debt financing for unpaid insurance claims  
**So that** the business can survive large losses

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add debt tracking to balance sheet
- [ ] Implement claim liability mechanism
- [ ] Model interest on claim-related debt (1.5% as Letter of Credit)
- [ ] Create debt repayment logic from operating income
- [ ] Ensure debt doesn't enable asset growth
- [ ] Write tests for debt scenarios

**Debt Mechanism**:
```python
def process_insurance_claim(self, claim_amount: float):
    """Handle large insurance claim requiring debt financing"""
    if claim_amount > self.assets - self.working_capital:
        debt_needed = claim_amount - available_cash
        self.debt += debt_needed
        self.assets += debt_needed  # Borrowed funds
    self.assets -= claim_amount  # Pay claim
    
def service_debt(self):
    """Pay interest and principal from operating income"""
    interest = self.debt * 0.015  # 1.5% LoC rate
    # Repayment logic here
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Debt only used for claims, not growth
- Interest correctly calculated and paid
- Debt-to-equity ratio tracked accurately
- Business can survive claims larger than cash

### Story 6: Exploration Notebooks

2. **Numerical stability over long periods**
   - Mitigation: Use appropriate data types (float64)
   - Validation: Check for overflow/underflow

3. **Performance for monthly resolution**
   - Mitigation: Vectorized operations with NumPy
   - Option: Cython optimization if needed

### Model Risks
1. **Oversimplified financial dynamics**
   - Mitigation: Document assumptions clearly
   - Plan: Enhance in future sprints

2. **Deterministic growth unrealistic**
   - Mitigation: Framework supports stochastic extension
   - Plan: Add randomness in Sprint 2
