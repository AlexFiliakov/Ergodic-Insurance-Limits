"""Widget manufacturer financial model implementation.

This module implements the core financial model for a widget manufacturing
company, providing comprehensive balance sheet management, insurance claim
processing, and stochastic modeling capabilities. It serves as the central
component of the ergodic insurance optimization framework.

The manufacturer model simulates realistic business operations including:
    - Asset-based revenue generation with configurable turnover ratios
    - Operating income calculations with industry-standard margins
    - Multi-layer insurance claim processing with deductibles and limits
    - Letter of credit collateral management for claim liabilities
    - Actuarial claim payment schedules over multiple years
    - Dynamic balance sheet evolution with growth and volatility
    - Integration with sophisticated stochastic processes
    - Comprehensive financial metrics and ratio analysis

Key Components:
    - :class:`WidgetManufacturer`: Main financial model class
    - :class:`ClaimLiability`: Actuarial claim payment tracking
    - Integration with :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.config` for parameter management
    - Integration with :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.stochastic_processes` for uncertainty

Examples:
    Basic manufacturer setup and simulation::

        from ergodic_insurance.config_v2 import ManufacturerConfig

            tax_rate=0.25,                      # 25% corporate tax rate
            retention_ratio=0.7                 # Retain 70% of earnings

        for year in range(20):
            # Process annual claims (example: 1 large claim every 5 years)
            if year % 5 == 0 and year > 0:

                    insurance_limit=15_000_000
                )

                  f"Assets=${metrics['assets']:,.0f}")

    Stochastic modeling with revenue volatility::

        from ergodic_insurance.stochastic_processes import (
            GeometricBrownianMotion, LognormalVolatility
        )

        # Create stochastic process for revenue volatility

        for simulation in range(1000):  # Monte Carlo
            stochastic_manufacturer.reset()

            for year in range(10):
                metrics = stochastic_manufacturer.step(
                    working_capital_pct=0.2,
                    apply_stochastic=True  # Enable volatility
                )

                if not metrics['is_solvent']:
                    break

            results.append(stochastic_manufacturer.equity)

        # Analyze results
        import numpy as np
        final_equity = np.array(results)
        print(f"Mean final equity: ${np.mean(final_equity):,.0f}")
        print(f"Std deviation: ${np.std(final_equity):,.0f}")
        print(f"Bankruptcy rate: {np.mean(final_equity <= 0):.1%}")

    Integration with claim development patterns::

        from ergodic_insurance.claim_development import (
            ClaimDevelopment, WorkersCompensation
        )

        # Enhanced claim processing with actuarial patterns
        wc_pattern = WorkersCompensation()

        company_paid, insurance_paid, claim_obj = manufacturer.process_insurance_claim_with_development(
            claim_amount=3_000_000,
            deductible=500_000,
            insurance_limit=5_000_000,
            development_pattern=wc_pattern,
            claim_type="workers_compensation"
        )

        if claim_obj:
            print(f"Claim created with ID: {claim_obj.claim_id}")
            print(f"Development pattern: {claim_obj.development_pattern.pattern_name}")

Financial Theory Background:
    The manufacturer model implements several key financial concepts:

    **Asset-Based Revenue Model**: Revenue = Assets Ã— Turnover Ratio, accounting
    for working capital requirements that tie up assets.

    **Multi-Period Claim Liabilities**: Insurance claims follow actuarial payment
    patterns over multiple years, requiring collateral management and cash flow
    planning.

    **Stochastic Business Dynamics**: Integration with geometric Brownian motion
    and other stochastic processes enables realistic volatility modeling.

    **Solvency Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of equity position with
    bankruptcy detection when liabilities exceed assets.

Performance Considerations:
    - The model is optimized for Monte Carlo simulations with 1000+ iterations
    - Memory efficient claim liability tracking automatically removes paid claims
    - Configurable time resolution (annual/monthly) for different analysis needs
    - Reset and copy methods enable parallel simulation scenarios

Integration Points:
    - :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.config_v2`: Parameter configuration and validation
    - :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.stochastic_processes`: Uncertainty modeling
    - :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.claim_generator`: Automated claim generation
    - :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.insurance_program`: Multi-layer insurance structures
    - :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.simulation`: High-level simulation orchestration

    :mod:`~ergodic_insurance.simulation`: Simulation framework integration

Note:
    This module forms the financial foundation for ergodic insurance optimization.
    All business logic assumes a debt-free balance sheet where equity equals
    net assets, simplifying the model while maintaining realistic cash flows.

@dataclass
class ClaimLiability:
    """Represents an outstanding insurance claim liability with payment schedule.

    This class tracks insurance claims that require multi-year payment
    schedules and manages the collateral required to support them. It follows
    standard actuarial claim development patterns for realistic cash flow modeling.

    The default payment schedule follows a typical long-tail liability pattern
    where claims are paid over 10 years, with higher percentages in early years
    and gradually decreasing payments over time. This pattern is commonly observed
    in general liability and workers' compensation claims.

    Attributes:
        original_amount (float): The original claim amount at inception.
        remaining_amount (float): The unpaid balance of the claim.
        year_incurred (int): The year when the claim was first incurred.
        is_insured (bool): Whether this claim involves insurance coverage.
            True for insured claims (company deductible), False for uninsured claims.
        payment_schedule (List[float]): Payment percentages by year since inception.
            Default follows a standard long-tail pattern:
            - Years 1-3: Front-loaded payments (10%, 20%, 20%)
            - Years 4-6: Moderate payments (15%, 10%, 8%)
            - Years 7-10: Tail payments (7%, 5%, 3%, 2%)

    Examples:
        Create and track a claim liability::

            # Create a $1M claim liability
            claim = ClaimLiability(
                original_amount=1_000_000,

                year_incurred=2023
            )

            # Get payment due in year 2 (1 year after incurred)
            payment_due = claim.get_payment(1)  # Returns 200,000 (20%)

            # Make the payment
            actual_payment = claim.make_payment(payment_due)
            print(f"Remaining: ${claim.remaining_amount:,.2f}")

        Custom payment schedule::

            # Create claim with custom 3-year schedule
            custom_claim = ClaimLiability(
                original_amount=500_000,
                remaining_amount=500_000,

                payment_schedule=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]  # 50%, 30%, 20%
            )

    Note:
        The payment schedule percentages should sum to 1.0 for full claim payout.
        Payments beyond the schedule length return 0.0.

                "monthly". Annual is standard for most analyses. Monthly provides
                granular cash flow modeling. Defaults to "annual".
            apply_stochastic (bool): Whether to apply stochastic shocks to

            - Processes scheduled claim payments
            - May trigger insolvency if losses exceed equity
            - Appends metrics to metrics_history

            ValueError: If time_resolution not "annual" or "monthly".
            ValueError: If working_capital_pct < 0 or >= 1.
            RuntimeError: If apply_stochastic=True but no stochastic process.

        Note:
            If the company is already insolvent, the method returns immediately
            with minimal processing. Monthly resolution scales revenue and
            operating income by 1/12 but keeps collateral costs as calculated
            monthly rates.

        Warning:
            Growth is applied cumulatively to asset_turnover_ratio. In long
            simulations with high growth rates, monitor for unrealistic values.

        This method restores all financial parameters to their configured
        initial values and clears historical data, enabling fresh simulation
        runs from the same starting point. It is essential for Monte Carlo
        analysis and parameter sensitivity studies.

        Side Effects:
            - Resets assets to config.initial_assets
            - Clears all collateral and restricted assets
            - Restores equity to initial assets (no debt assumption)
            - Resets asset_turnover_ratio to config value
            - Clears all outstanding claim liabilities
            - Resets time tracking to year 0, month 0
            - Restores solvency status to healthy
            - Clears metrics_history
            - Resets stochastic process (if present) to initial state
