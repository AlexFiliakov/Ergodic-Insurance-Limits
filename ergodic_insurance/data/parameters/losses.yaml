# Loss Distribution Configuration for Widget Manufacturing Inc.
# Aligned with risk landscape from blog draft

# Attritional Losses (High Frequency, Low Severity)
attritional:
  # Frequency: Poisson process
  frequency: 5.0  # λ = 5 claims per year

  # Severity: Log-normal distribution
  severity:
    mean: 25_000  # Mean loss amount $25K
    cv: 1.5       # Coefficient of variation = 1.5

  # Examples: Worker injuries, quality defects, minor property damage

# Large Losses (Medium Frequency, Medium Severity)
large:
  # Frequency: Poisson process
  frequency: 0.5  # λ = 0.5 claims per year (1 every 2 years)

  # Severity: Log-normal distribution
  severity:
    mean: 1_500_000  # Mean loss amount $1.5M
    cv: 2.0          # Coefficient of variation = 2.0

  # Examples: Product recalls, major equipment failures, litigation

# Catastrophic Events (Low Frequency, High Severity)
catastrophic:
  # Frequency: Poisson process
  frequency: 0.02  # λ = 0.02 claims per year (1-in-50 year events)

  # Severity: Pareto distribution for heavy tail
  severity:
    type: "pareto"
    alpha: 1.5      # Shape parameter (heavy tail)
    minimum: 5_000_000  # Minimum loss $5M

  # Examples: Environmental disasters, systemic product liability, cyber events

# Aggregate Statistics (for reference)
aggregate:
  # Expected annual loss calculation:
  # Attritional: 5 × $25K = $125K
  # Large: 0.5 × $1.5M = $750K
  # Catastrophic: 0.02 × E[Pareto] ≈ 0.02 × $15M = $300K
  # Total Expected Annual Loss ≈ $1.175M (11.75% of initial assets)
  expected_annual_loss: 1_175_000

  # As percentage of assets
  loss_ratio: 0.1175
