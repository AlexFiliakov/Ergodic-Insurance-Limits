# Getting Started with Ergodic Insurance Framework

Welcome to the Ergodic Insurance Framework! This tutorial will help you get up and running with your first insurance optimization analysis in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Install the framework and verify your setup
- Run your first manufacturer simulation
- Understand the basic output metrics
- Visualize wealth trajectories over time
- Learn where to go next

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher installed
- Basic familiarity with Python (ability to run scripts)
- No advanced mathematics or insurance knowledge required!

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Framework

If you have git installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/Ergodic-Insurance-Limits.git
cd Ergodic-Insurance-Limits
```

Or download the [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/Ergodic-Insurance-Limits/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

We recommend using `uv` for faster installation:
```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```

Alternatively, use standard pip:
```bash
cd ergodic_insurance
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Let's verify everything is working:

```python
# test_installation.py
from ergodic_insurance.manufacturer import WidgetManufacturer
from ergodic_insurance.claim_generator import ClaimGenerator
from ergodic_insurance.config_v2 import ManufacturerConfig

print("âœ… Framework imported successfully!")

# Create configuration
config = ManufacturerConfig(
    initial_assets=10_000_000,
    asset_turnover_ratio=1.0,
    operating_margin=0.08,
    tax_rate=0.25,
    retention_ratio=0.7
)

# Create a simple manufacturer
company = WidgetManufacturer(config)

print(f"âœ… Created company with ${company.assets:,.0f} in assets")
print("ðŸŽ‰ Installation successful!")
```

## Your First Simulation

Now let's run a real simulation to see how insurance affects your company's growth trajectory.

### Step 1: Create the Basic Setup

```python
# first_simulation.py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ergodic_insurance.manufacturer import WidgetManufacturer
from ergodic_insurance.claim_generator import ClaimGenerator
from ergodic_insurance.config_v2 import ManufacturerConfig

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Configure the manufacturer
config = ManufacturerConfig(
    initial_assets=10_000_000,    # Starting with $10M
    asset_turnover_ratio=1.0,     # Generate revenue equal to assets
    operating_margin=0.12,        # protif margin before losses (~8% margin after losses)
    tax_rate=0.25,                # 25% corporate tax
    retention_ratio=0.7           # Retain 70% of earnings
)

# Create a $10M widget manufacturer
manufacturer = WidgetManufacturer(config)

print(f"Company Profile:")
print(f"  Initial Assets: ${manufacturer.assets:,.0f}")
print(f"  Expected Annual Revenue: ${manufacturer.assets * config.asset_turnover_ratio:,.0f}")
print(f"  Expected Operating Income (Before Losses): ${manufacturer.assets * config.asset_turnover_ratio * config.operating_margin:,.0f}")
```

#### Expected Output:

```
Company Profile:
  Initial Assets: $10,000,000
  Expected Annual Revenue: $10,000,000
  Expected Operating Income (Before Losses): $1,200,000
```

### Step 2: Set Up Loss and Premium Parameters

```python
scenarios = 100
years = 20
deductible = 100_000

# Loss Parameters
regular_freq_baseline = 2.0
regular_sev_mean = 80_000
regular_sev_std = 50_000

cat_freq_baseline = 0.1
cat_sev_mean = 2_000_000
cat_sev_std = 1_500_000

# For regular losses (mean $80K), most will be below $100K deductible
# Calculate expected excess for lognormal distribution

# Lognormal parameters for regular losses
variance = regular_sev_std ** 2
mean = regular_sev_mean

sigma = np.sqrt(np.log(1 + variance / mean**2))
mu = np.log(mean) - sigma**2 / 2

# Generate sample to estimate excess over deductible
regular_sample = np.random.lognormal(mu, sigma, 100_000)
regular_excess = np.maximum(0, regular_sample - deductible)
regular_excess_pure_premium = regular_excess.mean() * regular_freq_baseline

# For catastrophic losses (mean $2M), nearly all will exceed $100K deductible
catastrophic_excess_pure_premium = (cat_sev_mean - deductible) * cat_freq_baseline

print(f"Baseline Revenue: {(config.initial_assets * config.asset_turnover_ratio):,.0f}")
print(f"Baseline Retained Losses: {(regular_sev_mean * regular_freq_baseline + cat_sev_mean * cat_freq_baseline - catastrophic_excess_pure_premium):,.0f}")

# Add expense loading
loss_ratio = 0.70
annual_premium_baseline = (regular_excess_pure_premium + catastrophic_excess_pure_premium) / loss_ratio

print(f"Baseline Annual Premium: {annual_premium_baseline:,.0f}")
```

#### Expected Output:

```
Baseline Revenue: 10,000,000
Baseline Retained Losses: 170,000
Baseline Annual Premium: 305,311
```

### Step 3: Run the Simulation

```python

bankruptcy_with_ins_scenarios = []

        # For no insurance, company pays all losses over time without collateral
        for claim in year_claims:

        manufacturer_no_ins.step()

    if manufacturer_no_ins.is_ruined:
        bankruptcy_no_ins_scenarios.append(scen)

    ### Configuration 2: With insurance ($100K deductible, $200M limit) #######

        regular_generator = ClaimGenerator(
            frequency=regular_frequency,
            severity_mean=regular_sev_mean,       # Mean claim size $80K

        )

            severity_std=cat_sev_std,     # High variation - can reach $5M+
        )

        # Generate regular losses for this year
        regular_claims, _ = regular_generator.generate_enhanced_claims(
            years=1,
            revenue=revenue,

## Understanding the Results

### Why Insurance Creates Value

This demonstration shows the true value of insurance: **protection against catastrophic losses that can bankrupt the company**.

#### The Loss Structure
1. **Regular Losses** (~2 per year, \$50K\$150K each)
   - These are manageable without insurance
   - Total ~$160K per year on average

2. **Catastrophic Losses** (~0.1 per year, \$1M-\$5M each)
   - Occur roughly once every 10 years
   - Can exceed annual profits by 2-5x
   - **These are what make insurance valuable**

*What's not shown in this scenario is that catastrophic attritional losses (retaining too much below the deductible) can also matter, as can extremely large losses above the limit.*

#### Key Insights

1. **Not Buying Insurance Outperforms Insurance At First**:
   - Ensemble Average dominates early on
   - As catastrophic losses get averaged into scenarios over time, the value of insurance emerges

2. **The Catastrophic Protection**:
   - Without insurance: A single loss can wipe out years of profits
   - With insurance: Maximum exposure is the deductible (\$100K) per event

3. **Long-term Growth Impact**:
   - Insurance smooths the growth trajectory
   - Prevents bankruptcy during catastrophic years
   - Enables compound growth over time

### What to Look For in the Graph

1. **Wealth Trajectories (Top Left)**:
   - Light Red lines designate scenarios without insurance that go bankrupt
     - Notice that many of these outperform insurance early on
   - Light Red and Orange lines with steep drops designate catastrophic events
     - Notice how "No Insurance" drops sharply at these points
   - "With Insurance" shows smoother, more consistent growth

## Common Patterns You'll See in Future Simulations

1. **The Insurance Paradox**: Sometimes paying 2-3x expected losses in premiums is optimal!
2. **Volatility Reduction**: Insurance smooths the wealth trajectory
3. **Growth vs. Safety Trade-off**: Lower retention = safer but more expensive
4. **Long-term Benefits**: Insurance benefits compound over time

## Next Steps

Now that you've run your first simulation, explore these topics:

1. **[Basic Simulation](02_basic_simulation.md)**: Deep dive into the simulation mechanics
2. **[Configuring Insurance](03_configuring_insurance.md)**: Understanding layers, retentions, and limits
3. **[Optimization Workflow](04_optimization_workflow.md)**: Finding the optimal insurance strategy
4. **[Analyzing Results](05_analyzing_results.md)**: Advanced metrics and decision-making

## Quick Tips

- **Start Simple**: Begin with single-layer insurance before exploring complex programs
- **Use Seeds**: Set `np.random.seed()` for reproducible results during testing
- **Experiment**: Try different retention levels to see the trade-offs
- **Think Long-term**: Run simulations for 20-50 years to see ergodic effects
