# Ergodic Insurance Part 2: The Untapped ROI of Insurance: Lessons from Widget Manufacturing Inc.

Executives often view insurance as a necessary cost. In Part 1, we showed how ergodic thinking reframes it as a growth engine ([read Part 1 here](https://medium.com/@alexfiliakov/ergodic-insurance-part-1-from-cost-center-to-growth-engine-when-n-1-52c17b048a94)). Now, in Part 2, we stress-test that claim with long-term simulated case study of a middle-market manufacturing company.

## High-Level Takeaways
- Bullet or prose format highlighting:
  - Optimal coverage can mean paying far more than expected loss.
  - Efficient frontier trade-off between ROE and ruin probability.
  - Nonlinear scaling of attachment points.
  - Critical coverage thresholds.
- (Placeholder: Figure – Efficient Frontier graph)
- (Placeholder: Table – Optimal limits vs. company size)

### Section Draft:
(Generally make each bullt a miniheadline. This structure gives senior leaders something memorable to quote. For example:)
- **Paying more can grow faster.** Optimal coverage often means paying far more than expected loss, but it maximizes long-term survival and wealth.
*See Appendix for detailed parameters.*

## The Story of Widget Manufacturing Inc.
- Storytelling style: “We built a time machine to watch a company evolve across 10,000 universes.”
- Simulation design: 10,000 paths × 1,000 years.
- Loss modeling (frequency/severity calibrated to manufacturing).
- Insurance coverage grid search.
- Performance metrics (time-average ROE, ruin probability, variability).
- (Placeholder: Mermaid diagram – simulation architecture flow)

### Section Draft:
To make this real, I modeled a fictional mid-size manufacturer, Widget Manufacturing Inc., and watched it evolve across 10,000 simulated universes over 1,000 years (detailed simulation parameters are available in the Appendix, as well as the GitHub repo).

## Findings and Discoveries
(Support with Graphs and tables)

### Where growth peaks: Optimal limits by business size

### The curve of trade-offs: balancing ROE with ruin probability

### Stress-testing the strategy: sensitivity results

### Premiums that pay for themselves: cost-benefit quantification

## Why These Results Matter
Consider framing each point as a myth-busting format.
- Why premiums > expected loss maximize growth.
- Why attachment points scale nonlinearly.
- The “ruin cliff” effect.
- Why loss cost ratios mislead.

If simulations show insurance is a growth engine, how do we convince CFOs, boards, and markets to act accordingly? That’s the challenge we’ll consider in Part 3.

“Ergodic Insurance Part 2: The Untapped ROI of Insurance: Lessons from Widget Manufacturing Inc.”

What do 10,000 simulated futures reveal about insurance as a hidden driver of long-term growth? In this post I tackle this question and uncover surprising insights, including:

📊 Determining the **optimal insurance retentions and limits** by business size

⚖️ Exploring the dreaded curve of trade-offs: **balancing ROE with ruin probability**

🔍 Stress testing and assessing the **sensitivity** of these results

💰 Quantifying the **cost-benefit**: premiums that pay for themselves
