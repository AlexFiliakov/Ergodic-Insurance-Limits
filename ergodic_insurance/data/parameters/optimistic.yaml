# Optimistic Configuration for Ergodic Insurance Model
# Growth-oriented parameters with aggressive assumptions

# Define common optimistic values as anchors
_optimistic_anchors:
  high_growth: &high_growth 0.08          # 8% annual growth
  high_margin: &high_margin 0.12          # 12% operating margin
  low_working_capital: &low_wc 0.15       # 15% of sales in WC
  full_retention: &full_retention 1.0     # 100% retention
  low_min_cash: &low_min_cash 50_000      # $50k minimum cash
