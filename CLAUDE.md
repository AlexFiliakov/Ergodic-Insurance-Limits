This project implements a framework for assessing insurance purchasing decisions and helps optimize insurance retentions and limits for businesses using ergodic theory (time-average) rather than traditional ensemble approaches. The framework aims to demonstrate how insurance transforms from a cost center to a growth enabler when analyzed through time averages.

The model is intended to be used with public financial data to model a real business, simulate an insurance market cycle, and optimize long-term business growth by selecting the right risk management strategy.

## Key Objectives
1. Build a complete simulation framework for ergodic insurance optimization
2. Generate compelling evidence for blog posts demonstrating ergodic advantages
3. Provide actuaries, CFOs, and risk managers with practical Python tools for insurance decision-making
4. Validate that optimal insurance premiums can exceed expected losses by 200-500% while enhancing growth

Primary Language: Python 3.12+
Version Control: Never commit directly to main branch - use feature branches
Code Quality: Run formatters and linters before committing
