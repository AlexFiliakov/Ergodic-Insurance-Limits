"""Optimal control strategies for insurance decisions.

This module provides implementations of various control strategies derived from
the HJB solver, including feedback control laws, state-dependent insurance limits,
and integration with the simulation framework.

Key Components:
    - ControlSpace: Defines feasible insurance control parameters
    - ControlStrategy: Abstract base for control strategies
    - StaticControl: Fixed insurance parameters throughout simulation
    - HJBFeedbackControl: State-dependent optimal control from HJB solution
    - TimeVaryingControl: Predetermined time-based control schedule
    - OptimalController: Integrates control strategies with simulations

Typical Workflow:
    1. Solve HJB equation to get optimal policy
    2. Create control strategy (e.g., HJBFeedbackControl)
    3. Initialize OptimalController with strategy
    4. Apply controls in simulation loop
    5. Track and analyze performance

Example:
    >>> # Solve HJB problem
    >>> solver = HJBSolver(problem, config)
    >>> value_func, policy = solver.solve()
    >>>
    >>> # Create feedback control
    >>> control_space = ControlSpace(
    ...     limits=[(1e6, 5e7)],
    ...     retentions=[(1e5, 1e7)]
    ... )
    >>> strategy = HJBFeedbackControl(solver, control_space)
    >>>
    >>> # Apply in simulation
    >>> controller = OptimalController(strategy, control_space)
    >>> insurance = controller.apply_control(manufacturer, time=t)
