# Ergodic Insurance Part 2: The Untapped ROI of Insurance: Lessons from Widget Manufacturing Inc.

Executives often view insurance as a necessary cost. In Part 1, we showed how ergodic thinking reframes it as a growth engine ([read Part 1 here](https://medium.com/@alexfiliakov/ergodic-insurance-part-1-from-cost-center-to-growth-engine-when-n-1-52c17b048a94)). Now, in Part 2, we stress-test that claim with long-term simulated case study of a middle-market manufacturing company.

## High-Level Takeaways
- Bullet or prose format highlighting:
  - Optimal coverage can mean paying 200-500% more than expected loss.
  - Efficient frontier trade-off between ROE and ruin probability.
  - Nonlinear scaling of attachment points with company size.
  - Critical coverage thresholds reveal "ruin cliffs".
- **Figure 1**: ROE-Ruin Efficient Frontier (executive summary view)
- **Table 1**: Optimal Insurance Limits by Company Size ($1M, $10M, $100M assets)

### Section Draft:
(Generally make each bullet a miniheadline. This structure gives senior leaders something memorable to quote. For example:)
- **Paying 3√ó expected losses maximizes growth.** Optimal coverage often means paying 200-500% of expected loss, but it maximizes long-term survival and wealth.
- **The 1% rule changes everything.** Constraining ruin probability below 1% fundamentally alters optimal strategy.
- **Size matters nonlinearly.** Optimal attachment points scale with ‚àö(assets), not linearly.
*See Appendix for detailed parameters and technical validation.*

## The Story of Widget Manufacturing Inc.
- Storytelling style: "We built a time machine to watch companies evolve across 10,000 universes."
- Simulation design: 10,000 paths √ó 1,000 years for three company sizes.
- Loss modeling (frequency/severity calibrated to manufacturing risks).
- Insurance coverage grid search across 100+ parameter combinations.
- Performance metrics (time-average ROE, ruin probability, growth volatility).
- **Figure 2**: Simulation Architecture Flow (simplified for executives)
- **Figure 3**: Sample Path Visualization (5 trajectories, 10-year and 100-year views)

### Section Draft:
To make this real, I modeled fictional manufacturers at three scales‚ÄîSmall ($1M assets), Medium ($10M), and Large ($100M)‚Äîand watched them evolve across 10,000 simulated universes over 1,000 years. The first decade matters to CFOs; the century validates the theory (detailed simulation parameters are available in the Appendix, as well as the GitHub repo).

## Findings and Discoveries
(Each subsection features 1-2 primary visualizations with executive insights)

### Where growth peaks: Optimal limits by business size
- **Figure 4**: Optimal Coverage Heatmap ($1M, $10M, $100M companies)
  - X-axis: Retention/deductible levels
  - Y-axis: Policy limits
  - Color: Time-average growth rate
- **Table 2**: Quick Reference - Optimal Insurance Structure by Size
- Key insight: Optimal limits scale sublinearly (approximately as assets^0.7)

### The curve of trade-offs: balancing ROE with ruin probability
- **Figure 5**: ROE-Ruin Trade-off Curves (all three company sizes)
  - Shows Pareto frontier for each size
  - Highlights "sweet spot" regions
- **Figure 6**: The Ruin Cliff Visualization
  - Dramatic visualization showing sudden failure threshold
  - Retention vs 10-year ruin probability with cliff edge marked
- Key insight: Small changes near the cliff cause dramatic survival differences

### Stress-testing the strategy: sensitivity results
- **Figure 7**: Tornado Chart - Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
  - Shows which parameters most affect optimal strategy
- **Figure 8**: Robustness Heatmap
  - How optimal coverage changes with loss frequency/severity assumptions
- Key insight: Strategy remains robust across ¬±30% parameter variations

### Premiums that pay for themselves: cost-benefit quantification
- **Figure 9**: Premium Multiplier Analysis
  - Shows optimal premium as multiple of expected loss (2√ó, 3√ó, 5√ó)
  - Separate curves for each company size
- **Figure 10**: Break-even Timeline
  - When cumulative growth benefit exceeds cumulative excess premiums
  - Shows both median and percentile bands (25th, 75th)
- Key insight: Insurance "pays for itself" within 3-7 years for optimal coverage

## Why These Results Matter
Consider framing each point as a myth-busting format.
- Why premiums > expected loss maximize growth.
- Why attachment points scale nonlinearly.
- The ‚Äúruin cliff‚Äù effect.
- Why loss cost ratios mislead.

If simulations show insurance is a growth engine, how do we convince CFOs, boards, and markets to act accordingly? That‚Äôs the challenge we‚Äôll consider in Part 3.
