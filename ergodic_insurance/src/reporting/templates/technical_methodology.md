# Technical Methodology

## Overview

This technical appendix provides detailed documentation of the methodologies, algorithms, and validation procedures used in the insurance optimization analysis. The approach combines ergodic theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and advanced optimization techniques to identify optimal insurance structures.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Ergodic Theory in Finance

The ergodic hypothesis states that for certain systems, time averages equal ensemble averages. However, in multiplicative stochastic processes typical of financial systems, this equality breaks down, leading to fundamentally different optimization criteria.

#### Time Average vs Ensemble Average

For a wealth process W(t), the distinction is:

- **Ensemble Average**: E[W(t)] - Expected value across many parallel universes
- **Time Average**: lim(T→∞) (1/T) log(W(T)/W(0)) - Growth rate experienced by a single entity

This distinction becomes critical when losses can be catastrophic, as the time average explicitly accounts for the possibility of ruin.

### Insurance Impact on Growth Dynamics

Insurance modifies the wealth dynamics by:

1. **Truncating left tail**: Capping maximum losses
2. **Reducing variance**: Stabilizing cash flows
3. **Introducing fixed costs**: Premium payments

The net effect on time-average growth depends on the balance between variance reduction benefits and premium costs.

## Simulation Framework

### Stochastic Process Models

#### Loss Generation
Losses are modeled as a compound Poisson process:
- Frequency: N(t) ~ Poisson(λt)
- Severity: Li ~ LogNormal(μ, σ²)
- Annual aggregate: S(t) = Σ(i=1 to N(t)) Li

#### Revenue Dynamics
Revenue follows geometric Brownian motion with mean reversion:
- dR(t) = κ(θ - R(t))dt + σR(t)dW(t)
- κ: Mean reversion speed
- θ: Long-term mean level
- σ: Volatility parameter

### Numerical Implementation

#### Discretization Scheme
We employ the Euler-Maruyama method with adaptive timestep:
- Δt = min(1/252, 0.1/σ²)
- X(t+Δt) = X(t) + μX(t)Δt + σX(t)√Δt·Z
- Z ~ N(0,1)

#### Variance Reduction Techniques

1. **Antithetic Variates**: Generate pairs (Z, -Z) to reduce variance
2. **Control Variates**: Use analytical solutions as controls
3. **Importance Sampling**: Focus simulation on critical regions
4. **Stratified Sampling**: Ensure coverage of parameter space

## Optimization Algorithms

### Multi-Objective Optimization

The optimization problem is formulated as:

maximize: f₁(x) = ROE(x)
subject to: f₂(x) = P(ruin|x) < α
           xₘᵢₙ ≤ x ≤ xₘₐₓ

Where:
- x: Insurance limit vector
- α: Maximum acceptable ruin probability
- ROE: Return on equity function

### Solution Methods

#### 1. Particle Swarm Optimization
- Population-based metaheuristic
- Balances exploration and exploitation
- Handles non-convex objective functions

#### 2. Sequential Quadratic Programming
- For local refinement of solutions
- Exploits gradient information
- Ensures convergence to local optima

#### 3. Pareto Frontier Construction
- ε-constraint method for multi-objective problems
- Generates efficient frontier of solutions
- Enables trade-off analysis

## Convergence Analysis

### Diagnostics Employed

1. **Gelman-Rubin Statistic**: Measures between-chain vs within-chain variance
2. **Effective Sample Size**: Accounts for autocorrelation
3. **Geweke Diagnostic**: Tests for mean stationarity
4. **Heidelberger-Welch Test**: Assesses convergence and calculates half-width

### Stopping Criteria

Simulations terminate when ALL of the following are satisfied:
- Gelman-Rubin R̂ < 1.1
- Effective Sample Size > 1000
- Relative Standard Error < 1%
- Batch Means p-value > 0.05
