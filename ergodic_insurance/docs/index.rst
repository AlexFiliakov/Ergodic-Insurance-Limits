Ergodic Insurance Limits Documentation
=======================================

Welcome to the documentation for Ergodic Insurance Limits, a revolutionary framework for optimizing
insurance limits using ergodic (time-average) theory rather than traditional ensemble approaches.

The framework demonstrates how insurance transforms from a cost center to a growth enabler when
analyzed through time averages, with potential for 30-50% better long-term performance in widget
manufacturing scenarios.
