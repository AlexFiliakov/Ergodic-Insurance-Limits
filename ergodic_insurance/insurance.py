"""Insurance policy structure and claim processing.

This module provides classes for modeling multi-layer insurance policies
with configurable attachment points, limits, and premium rates. It supports
complex insurance structures commonly used in commercial insurance including
excess layers, umbrella coverage, and multi-layer towers.

The module integrates with pricing engines for dynamic premium calculation
and supports both static and market-driven pricing models.

Key Features:
    - Multi-layer insurance towers with attachment points and limits
    - Deductible and self-insured retention handling
    - Dynamic pricing integration with market cycles
    - Claim allocation across multiple layers
    - Premium calculation with various rating methods

Examples:
    Simple single-layer policy::

        from ergodic_insurance.src.insurance import InsurancePolicy, InsuranceLayer

        # $5M excess $1M with 3% rate
        layer = InsuranceLayer(
            attachment_point=1_000_000,
            limit=5_000_000,
            rate=0.03
        )

        policy = InsurancePolicy(
            layers=[layer],
            deductible=500_000
        )

        # Process a $3M claim
        company_payment, insurance_recovery = policy.process_claim(3_000_000)

    Multi-layer tower::

        # Build a insurance tower
        layers = [
            InsuranceLayer(1_000_000, 4_000_000, 0.025),  # Primary
            InsuranceLayer(5_000_000, 5_000_000, 0.015),  # First excess
            InsuranceLayer(10_000_000, 10_000_000, 0.01), # Second excess
        ]

        tower = InsurancePolicy(layers, deductible=1_000_000)
        annual_premium = tower.calculate_premium()

Note:
    For advanced features like reinstatements and complex multi-layer programs,
    see the insurance_program module which provides EnhancedInsuranceLayer and
    InsuranceProgram classes.

    Each layer has an attachment point (where coverage starts),
    a limit (maximum coverage), and a rate (premium percentage).
    Insurance layers are the building blocks of complex insurance programs.

    Attributes:
        attachment_point: Dollar amount where this layer starts providing
            coverage. Also known as the retention or excess point.
        limit: Maximum coverage amount from this layer. The layer covers
            losses from attachment_point to (attachment_point + limit).
        rate: Premium rate as a percentage of the limit. For example,
            0.03 means 3% of limit as annual premium.

    Examples:
        Primary layer with $1M retention::

            primary = InsuranceLayer(
