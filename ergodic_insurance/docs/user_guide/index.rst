Key Insight
-----------

**The Insurance Paradox**: Traditional insurance analysis uses ensemble averages (expected values across many companies). But your company experiences time averages (growth over years). These can differ dramatically. Our framework shows that paying 200-500% of expected losses can be optimal when viewed through the lens of time-average growth.
