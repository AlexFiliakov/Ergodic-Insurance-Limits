# Maximum justifiable premium calculation
def calculate_maximum_justifiable_premium(self, base_paths: List[Path]) -> float:
    """Find highest premium that still improves ergodic growth"""
    time_avg_uninsured = self.calculate_average_growth_rate(base_paths)

    for premium_multiple in np.linspace(1.0, 5.0, 41):
        insured_paths = self.simulate_with_insurance(premium_multiple)
        time_avg_insured = self.calculate_average_growth_rate(insured_paths)

        if time_avg_insured < time_avg_uninsured:
            return premium_multiple - 0.1
