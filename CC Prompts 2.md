work on issue #46 "Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Solver for Optimal Control". Ask me clarifying questions, then proceed to resolve the issue. Make sure that all new and existing tests pass before closing the issue.

---

put the configuration plan as you outlined in `CONFIG_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` and `CONFIG_MIGRATION_TASKS.md` into a GitHub issue. Put all the work into a single GitHub issue labeled "enhancement" and "priority-high" and give it an appropriate title.

---

Update all docstrings in modules, submodules, classes, methods, and functions to aid development and understandability of the code. Adhere to the Google docstring style. Then update README.md and CLAUDE.md with the latest directory structures. Then update Sphinx documentation templates for the newest code structure, ensuring the documentation clearly references the refactored configuration with clear and practical demos.

---

Fix the following sphinx `make html` warnings. Ultrathink to plan, make a list of todos, and then execute:


---

work on issue #48 "Design and Implement Enhanced Parallel Simulation Architecture". Ask me clarifying questions, then ultrathink and create an execution list, and then proceed to resolve the issue. Make sure that all new and existing tests pass. Update all docstrings in modules, submodules, classes, methods, and functions to aid development and understandability of the code. Adhere to the Google docstring style. Then update README.md and CLAUDE.md with the latest directory structures. Then update Sphinx documentation templates for the newest code structure, ensuring the documentation clearly references the refactored configuration with clear and practical demos. Once everything is thoroughly completed, create a pull request.

---

work to complete GitHub issue #80 "Implement Sensitivity Analysis Tools" and patch tests and jupyter notebooks as you go along, making sure all tests pass with high quality validation (avoiding things like always-true tests, or excessive mocks). Provide solid documentation using Google style docstrings. Ask me clarifying questions, ultrathink to make a plan, review the plan for completeness, then execute.
