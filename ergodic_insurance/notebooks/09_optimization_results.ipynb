    "This notebook demonstrates how ergodic (time-average) optimization of insurance programs yields superior long-term growth compared to traditional ensemble (expected value) approaches. Through comprehensive simulations, we show that optimal insurance premiums can exceed expected losses by 200-500% while enhancing ROE by 30-50%, transforming insurance from a cost center to a growth enabler."
