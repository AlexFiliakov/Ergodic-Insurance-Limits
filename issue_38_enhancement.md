## Enhanced Implementation Details for Business User Guide

Based on the sprint review and current codebase state, I'm providing comprehensive implementation details for this critical documentation piece.

### Context & Complexity Assessment
- **Complexity Score**: 7/10 (requires integration across multiple components)
- **Project Status**: 93% Sprint 2 completion with robust ergodic framework
- **Prerequisites**: Complete testing improvements (#34) and visualization enhancements

### Technical Architecture Available for Guide

#### 1. Core Simulation Framework
The guide can leverage these implemented components:
- `WidgetManufacturer` class with full financial modeling
- `MonteCarloEngine` with 100K+ scenario capability
- `ErgodicAnalyzer` for time-average vs ensemble comparison
- `InsuranceProgram` with multi-layer optimization

#### 2. Configuration System
User-friendly YAML parameters already implemented:
- `baseline.yaml`, `conservative.yaml`, `optimistic.yaml`
- Stochastic process toggles (GBM, lognormal, mean-reversion)
- Insurance layer structures with customizable limits/premiums

#### 3. Risk Metrics Suite
Business-ready analytics:
- Value at Risk (95th, 99th percentiles)
- Expected Shortfall / Conditional VaR
- Maximum Drawdown analysis
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios)
- Survival probability calculations

### Proposed Guide Structure

#### Part 1: Executive Summary (2 pages)
**Target Audience**: CFOs, Board Members
- The Insurance Paradox: Why paying 200-500% of expected losses can be optimal
- The N=1 Problem: Your company's journey through time, not across universes
- Key Insight: Time-average growth vs ensemble expectations
- Bottom Line: 30-50% better long-term performance possible

#### Part 2: Quick Start Guide (5 pages)
**Target Audience**: Entry-level actuaries, risk managers

##### 2.1 Your Company Profile
Interactive worksheet to input:
```yaml
company:
  starting_assets: 10_000_000  # Your company's asset base
  revenue: 15_000_000          # Annual revenue
  operating_margin: 0.08       # Profit margin (8%)

risk_profile:
  small_losses_per_year: 5     # Frequency of minor incidents
  large_loss_probability: 0.3  # Chance of major loss per year
  catastrophic_risk: 0.02      # Extreme event probability
```

##### 2.2 Understanding Your Losses
Visual guide to loss categories:
- **Attritional**: Daily operational hiccups ($10K-$100K)
- **Large**: Significant disruptions ($500K-$5M)
- **Catastrophic**: Business-threatening events ($5M+)

##### 2.3 Insurance Layer Cake
Interactive visualization showing:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐ $100M
│   Excess of Excess      │ Premium: 0.2% of limit
├─────────────────────────┤ $25M
│   First Excess Layer    │ Premium: 0.5% of limit
├─────────────────────────┤ $5M
│   Primary Layer         │ Premium: 1.0% of limit
├─────────────────────────┤ $100K
│   Retention (You Pay)   │ Your deductible
└─────────────────────────┘ $0
```

#### Part 3: Running Your Analysis (10 pages)
**Step-by-step walkthrough with screenshots**

##### 3.1 Setting Up Your Scenario
```python
from ergodic_insurance import BusinessOptimizer

# Load your company profile
optimizer = BusinessOptimizer.from_yaml('my_company.yaml')

# Run baseline analysis
baseline = optimizer.analyze_current_state()
print(f"Current 10-year survival probability: {baseline.survival_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Average annual growth rate: {baseline.growth_rate:.1%}")
```

##### 3.2 Exploring Insurance Options
Interactive Jupyter notebook showing:
- Retention level sensitivity (deductible optimization)
- Limit selection trade-offs
- Premium vs growth rate curves
- Survival probability improvements

##### 3.3 Interpreting Results
Clear explanations of key metrics:
- **Time-Average Growth**: Your actual experienced growth rate
- **Ensemble Average**: Theoretical expectation (often misleading!)
- **Ergodic Premium**: Maximum you should pay for insurance
- **Survival-Adjusted Return**: Growth assuming you survive

#### Part 4: Decision Framework (8 pages)

##### 4.1 The Three Questions
1. **What's my ruin probability without insurance?**
   - If >5%: Insurance is mandatory
   - If 1-5%: Insurance strongly recommended
   - If <1%: Optimize for growth

2. **What's my optimal retention?**
   - Rule of thumb: 1-2% of assets
   - Higher if stable cash flow
   - Lower if volatile industry

3. **How much limit do I need?**
   - Minimum: 1-in-100 year loss level
   - Recommended: 1-in-200 year loss level
   - Consider: Contractual requirements

##### 4.2 Red Flags to Avoid
Common mistakes in insurance decisions:
- Using expected value instead of time-average
- Ignoring correlation between business cycles and losses
- Underestimating catastrophic tail risk
- Over-insuring predictable losses

##### 4.3 Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Gather 3-5 years of loss history
- [ ] Estimate revenue volatility
- [ ] Run baseline simulation (no insurance)
- [ ] Test 3-5 insurance structures
- [ ] Compare time-average growth rates
- [ ] Validate survival probabilities
- [ ] Document assumptions
- [ ] Review with stakeholders

#### Part 5: Case Studies (10 pages)

##### Case 1: Widget Manufacturer
- $10M assets, 15% volatility
- Result: Optimal retention $100K, limit $25M
- Outcome: 35% better 10-year growth

##### Case 2: Tech Startup
- $5M assets, 40% volatility
