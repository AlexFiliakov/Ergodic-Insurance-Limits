    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble average overstates returns.** It averages across many parallel worlds; you only live in one.\n",
    "- **Time average is what you experience.** Volatility drag from large losses permanently impairs compounding.\n",
    "- **Insurance is a growth tool, not just a cost.** By smoothing out catastrophic losses, insurance enhances your realized long-term growth rate.\n",
    "- **The \"premium puzzle\" is resolved.** Rational actors buy insurance because they (correctly) optimize for time-average growth, not ensemble-average expectations.\n",
