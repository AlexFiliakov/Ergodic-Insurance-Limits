# User Tutorials and How-To Guides

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial series for the Ergodic Insurance Framework. These hands-on guides will walk you through everything from basic setup to advanced insurance optimization strategies.

## Getting Started

New to the framework? Start with [Getting Started](getting_started.md) to get up and running in minutes!

## Tutorial Overview

Our tutorials are designed to take you from beginner to expert:

1. **[Getting Started](getting_started.md)** - Installation, setup, and your first simulation
2. **[Basic Simulation](basic_simulation.md)** - Understanding the simulation engine and parameters
3. **[Configuring Insurance](configuring_insurance.md)** - Setting up single and multi-layer insurance programs
4. **[Optimization Workflow](optimization_workflow.md)** - Finding optimal insurance strategies
5. **[Analyzing Results](analyzing_results.md)** - Interpreting metrics and making decisions
6. **[Advanced Scenarios](advanced_scenarios.md)** - Real-world applications and complex strategies

## Quick Start Paths

Depending on your role and objectives, follow these recommended paths:

### For Actuaries and Risk Managers
1. [Getting Started](getting_started.md)
2. [Configuring Insurance](configuring_insurance.md)
3. [Analyzing Results](analyzing_results.md)

### For Financial Analysts
1. [Getting Started](getting_started.md)

## Support Resources

- [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tutorials, you will be able to:

* **Set up and run** insurance simulations for your specific use case
* **Configure** complex multi-layer insurance programs
* **Optimize** insurance parameters for maximum growth while controlling risk
* **Analyze** results using ergodic theory principles
* **Apply** the framework to real-world business scenarios
* **Troubleshoot** common issues and optimize performance

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Basic Python knowledge (running scripts, installing packages)

**Helpful but not required:**
- Understanding of insurance concepts (retention, limits, premiums)
- Basic statistics knowledge (distributions, averages)
- Familiarity with financial metrics (ROE, ROA)

## Interactive Learning

All tutorials include:
- **Working code examples** that you can run immediately
- **Visualizations** to understand concepts intuitively
- **Best practices** from real-world applications
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Exercises** to test your understanding

## Code Examples

All code examples in these tutorials are:
- âœ… **Tested** - Every example has been verified to work
- âœ… **Complete** - Full working code, not just snippets
- âœ… **Documented** - Clear comments explaining each step
- âœ… **Practical** - Based on real-world use cases

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) guide for common problems
2. Review the example notebooks in the project repository
3. Consult the API documentation for detailed function documentation
4. File an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/Ergodic-Insurance-Limits/issues)

## Tutorial Notebooks

Jupyter notebook versions of these tutorials are available in the project repository under `ergodic_insurance/notebooks/tutorials/`

These notebooks allow you to:
- Run code interactively
- Modify parameters and see results immediately
- Save your own experiments and notes
- Share analyses with colleagues

## Next Steps

Ready to begin? Start with [Getting Started](getting_started.md) to install the framework and run your first simulation!

For those who prefer learning by example, check out our example scripts and notebooks in the repository.

**Time Investment:** Each tutorial takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. The entire series can be completed in about 4 hours.

## Happy Learning!

We're excited to help you master insurance optimization using ergodic theory. These tutorials represent the culmination of extensive research and real-world application.

Let's transform insurance from a cost center to a growth enabler! ðŸš€
