# Glossary of Terms

## A

**Attachment Point**
The dollar amount at which an insurance layer begins to pay claims. Also called the retention or deductible for that layer.

**Attritional Losses**
High-frequency, low-severity losses that occur regularly in business operations. Typically handled by primary insurance layers.

**Asset Turnover**
The ratio of revenue to assets, measuring how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

## B

**Burning Cost**
Historical average losses as a percentage of exposure, used as a baseline for insurance pricing.

## C

**Captive Insurance**
A wholly-owned subsidiary created to provide insurance to its parent company, allowing for risk retention with tax benefits.

**Catastrophic Loss**
An extremely large, rare loss event that could threaten company solvency without insurance.

**Claim Development**
The pattern by which insurance claims are reported and paid over time after a loss event occurs.

**Coherent Risk Measure**
A risk measure satisfying mathematical properties including monotonicity, sub-additivity, homogeneity, and translation invariance.

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**
The expected loss given that the loss exceeds the Value at Risk threshold. Also called Expected Shortfall.

**Convergence**
In ergodic theory, when time averages approach ensemble averages as the time period extends to infinity.

## D

**Deductible**
The amount of loss retained by the insured before insurance coverage begins. See also Retention.

## E

**Ensemble Average**
The expected value calculated across all possible outcomes at a single point in time. Traditional basis for insurance pricing.

**Ergodic**
A system property where time averages equal ensemble averages in the limit. Most financial systems are non-ergodic.

**Ergodic Theory**
Mathematical framework studying the long-term average behavior of systems evolving over time.

**Excess Insurance**
Insurance coverage that applies above a specified attachment point, typically after primary insurance is exhausted.

**Expected Loss**
The probability-weighted average of all possible loss amounts. The traditional basis for insurance pricing.

**Expected Shortfall**
See Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).

## F

**Frequency**
The number of loss events occurring in a given time period, often modeled with Poisson distribution.

## G

**Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
A stochastic process used to model asset prices and company growth with random volatility.

**Growth Rate**
In ergodic analysis, the time-average rate of change in wealth or assets, accounting for volatility effects.

## H

**Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation**
A partial differential equation providing necessary conditions for optimality in continuous-time optimal control problems.

## I

**IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported)**
Losses that have occurred but haven't yet been reported to the insurer.

**Insurance Layer**
A specific segment of coverage defined by its attachment point and limit.

**Insurance Limit**
The maximum amount an insurer will pay for covered losses during the policy period.

**Insurance Premium**
The cost paid for insurance coverage, typically expressed as an annual amount.

## L

**Large Loss**
A significant loss event that is infrequent but severe when it occurs.

**Layer**
See Insurance Layer.

**Limit**
See Insurance Limit.

**Lognormal Distribution**
A probability distribution where the logarithm is normally distributed, commonly used for modeling loss severities.

**Loss Distribution**
The probability distribution describing the frequency and severity of losses.

## M

**Mean Reversion**
The tendency of a variable to return to its long-term average over time.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**
A computational technique using random sampling to obtain numerical results for complex problems.

**Multi-layer Program**
An insurance structure with multiple layers of coverage at different attachment points and limits.

**Multiplicative Process**
A process where changes are proportional to current values, leading to compound effects over time.

## N

**Non-ergodic**
A system where time averages differ from ensemble averages, common in finance and economics.

## O

**Operating Margin**
The percentage of revenue remaining after operating expenses but before interest and taxes.

**Optimal Control**
Mathematical optimization method for finding the best control strategy over time.

**Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**
A mean-reverting stochastic process used to model variables that tend toward a long-term average.

## P

**Pareto Distribution**
A heavy-tailed distribution often used for modeling large losses.

**Pareto Frontier**
The set of optimal solutions when optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously.

**Path Dependence**
When outcomes depend on the specific sequence of events, not just the final state.

**Poisson Process**
A stochastic process modeling the occurrence of random events over time, used for loss frequency.

**Premium Loading**
The amount by which insurance premium exceeds expected losses to cover expenses and profit.

**Primary Insurance**
The first layer of insurance coverage, typically handling frequent, smaller losses.

## R

**Reinsurance**
Insurance purchased by insurance companies to transfer risk.

**Retention**
The amount of risk kept by the insured. Also called deductible or self-insured retention (SIR).

**Return Period**
The average time between occurrences of a loss exceeding a given size.

**Risk Metrics**
Quantitative measures of risk exposure, including VaR, CVaR, standard deviation, etc.

**ROA (Return on Assets)**
Net income divided by total assets, measuring asset efficiency.

**ROE (Return on Equity)**
Net income divided by shareholder equity, measuring returns to owners.

**Ruin Probability**
The probability that assets will fall below a critical threshold during a specified time period.

## S

**Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**
The amount of loss retained by the insured before insurance responds. Similar to a deductible.

**Severity**
The dollar amount of an individual loss event.

**Simulation**
Computational modeling of system behavior over time using mathematical models.

**Stochastic Process**
A mathematical model for random phenomena evolving over time.

**Stress Testing**
Evaluating system performance under extreme but plausible adverse conditions.

## T

**Tail Risk**
The risk of extreme events in the tails of the probability distribution.

**Time Average**
The average value experienced by a single entity over time, central to ergodic theory.

**Time Horizon**
The time period over which analysis or optimization is performed.

**Total Cost of Risk (TCOR)**
The sum of retained losses, insurance premiums, and risk management costs.

## V

**Value at Risk (VaR)**
The loss amount that will not be exceeded with a specified confidence level.

**Variance**
A measure of variability or dispersion in outcomes.

**Volatility**
The degree of variation in a variable over time, often measured as standard deviation.

**Volatility Drag**
The reduction in long-term growth rate caused by volatility in a multiplicative process.

## W

**Walk-Forward Analysis**
A validation technique using sequential time periods to test strategy robustness.

**Working Capital**
