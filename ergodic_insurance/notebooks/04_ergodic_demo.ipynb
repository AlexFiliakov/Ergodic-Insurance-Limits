    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration reveals the fundamental insight of ergodic economics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insurance appears expensive from ensemble perspective** \n",
    "   - Premiums exceed expected losses by 50-200%\n",
    "   - Traditional expected value analysis suggests avoiding insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insurance is optimal from time-average perspective**\n",
    "   - Enhances long-term growth rates by reducing volatility\n",
    "   - Dramatically improves survival probability\n",
    "   - The \"cost\" is actually an investment in stability\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The ergodic hypothesis fails for multiplicative processes**\n",
    "   - Ensemble average ≠ Time average for wealth dynamics\n",
    "   - Individual actors experience time averages, not ensemble averages\n",
    "   - This explains why rational actors buy \"expensive\" insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Businesses**: Insurance transforms from cost center to growth enabler\n",
    "- **For Actuaries**: Pricing should consider ergodic effects, not just expected values\n",
    "- **For Risk Managers**: Focus on time-average optimization, not expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The insurance puzzle is resolved: People and businesses buy insurance not because they're risk-averse in the traditional sense, but because they correctly optimize for time-average growth rather than ensemble-average outcomes. Insurance is not about avoiding losses, it's about optimizing growth trajectories in a multiplicative world."
