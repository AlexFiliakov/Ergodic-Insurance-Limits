    "# Reconciliation #01: Balance Sheet Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **What this notebook tests:** The fundamental accounting identity `Assets = Liabilities + Equity` holds at every time step across a multi-year simulation, and that retained earnings correctly accumulate net income minus dividends.\n",
    "- **Prerequisites:** `pip install -e .` from the project root.\n",
    "- **Estimated runtime:** < 60 seconds\n",
    "- **Audience:** Developers, actuaries, and auditors verifying accounting integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checks Performed\n",
    "1. **Accounting Identity:** `Total Assets == Total Liabilities + Total Equity` at each year-end (tolerance < $0.01)\n",
    "2. **Retained Earnings Accumulation:** `RE[t] == RE[t-1] + Net Income[t] - Dividends[t]`\n",
    "3. **Accumulated Depreciation Consistency:** Accumulated depreciation grows consistently with depreciation expense\n",
    "4. **Ledger Trial Balance:** Total debits == total credits (the ledger is balanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "We create a `WidgetManufacturer` with known initial conditions ($10M assets, 10% margin, 25% tax rate) and run a deterministic 10-year simulation with zero growth rate (no stochastic shocks). At each year-end we extract the full balance sheet from the ledger and verify the identities above."
