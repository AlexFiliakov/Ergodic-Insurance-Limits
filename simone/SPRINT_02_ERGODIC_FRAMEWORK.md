# Sprint 2: Ergodic Framework - Stochastic Dynamics & Insurance Integration

## Sprint Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Goal**: Transform the deterministic financial model into a stochastic ergodic framework with insurance mechanisms
**Key Outcome**: Demonstrate ergodic advantages over traditional ensemble approaches through 100,000 scenario Monte Carlo simulations

## Sprint Objectives

1. Implement stochastic elements (growth rates, claim events, sales volatility)
2. Build ergodic framework for time-average vs ensemble-average analysis
3. Integrate basic insurance mechanisms (deductibles, limits, premiums)
4. Create high-performance Monte Carlo simulation engine
5. Develop comparative analysis demonstrating ergodic insurance advantages
6. Build exploration notebooks showing insurance puzzle resolution

## Technical Decisions

### Stochastic Model Architecture
$- **Sales volatility**: Lognormal distribution (\mu = 12-16, \sigma = 0.8-1.5) applied to baseline revenue$
- **Growth rates**: Stochastic variations around deterministic baseline using geometric Brownian motion
- **Claim events**: Dual-frequency model (attritional + large losses) with Poisson-Lognormal structure
- **Time resolution**: Monthly stochastic events, annual aggregation for ergodic calculations

### Ergodic Framework Implementation
- **Time-average growth**: $g = \lim_{T\to\infty}{\frac{1}{T}\ln{\frac{x(T)}{x(0)}}}$ calculated over 1000-year paths
- **Ensemble average**: Traditional expected value calculations across scenarios
- **Convergence monitoring**: Gelman-Rubin R-hat < 1.1 for 100,000 scenario validation
- **Performance target**: 100,000 scenarios Ã— 1000 years completed in reasonable time

### Insurance Layer Structure
- **Primary retention**: \$100K (industry standard for attritional losses)
- **Primary layer**: \$100K - $5M (0.5-1.5% premium rate, 60-80% loss ratio)
- **First excess**: \$5M - $25M (0.3-0.8% premium rate, 45% loss ratio)
- **Higher excess**: \$25M+ (0.1-0.4% premium rate, 30% loss ratio)
