Learning Objectives
-------------------

By completing these tutorials, you will be able to:

* **Set up and run** insurance simulations for your specific use case
* **Configure** complex multi-layer insurance programs
* **Optimize** insurance parameters for maximum growth while controlling risk
* **Analyze** results using ergodic theory principles
* **Apply** the framework to real-world business scenarios
* **Troubleshoot** common issues and optimize performance

Prerequisites
-------------

**Required:**
   * Python 3.12 or higher
   * Basic Python knowledge (running scripts, installing packages)

**Helpful but not required:**
   * Understanding of insurance concepts (retention, limits, premiums)
   * Basic statistics knowledge (distributions, averages)
   * Familiarity with financial metrics (ROE, ROA)

Interactive Learning
--------------------

All tutorials include:

* **Working code examples** that you can run immediately
* **Visualizations** to understand concepts intuitively
* **Best practices** from real-world applications
* **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
* **Exercises** to test your understanding

Code Examples
-------------

All code examples in these tutorials are:

* âœ… **Tested** - Every example has been verified to work
* âœ… **Complete** - Full working code, not just snippets
* âœ… **Documented** - Clear comments explaining each step
* âœ… **Practical** - Based on real-world use cases

Getting Help
------------

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the :doc:`troubleshooting` guide for common problems
2. Review the example notebooks in ``ergodic_insurance/notebooks/``
3. Consult the :doc:`../api/modules` for detailed function documentation
4. File an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/Ergodic-Insurance-Limits/issues>`__

Tutorial Notebooks
------------------

Jupyter notebook versions of these tutorials are available in:
``ergodic_insurance/notebooks/tutorials/``

These notebooks allow you to:

* Run code interactively
* Modify parameters and see results immediately
* Save your own experiments and notes
* Share analyses with colleagues

Next Steps
----------

Ready to begin? Start with :doc:`01_getting_started` to install the framework and run your first simulation!

For those who prefer learning by example, check out our :doc:`../examples` section for complete working demonstrations.

.. note::
   **Time Investment:** Each tutorial takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. The entire series can be completed in about 4 hours.
