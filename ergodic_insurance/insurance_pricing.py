"""Insurance pricing module with market cycle support.

This module implements realistic insurance premium calculation based on
frequency and severity distributions, replacing hardcoded premium rates
in simulations. It supports market cycle adjustments and integrates with
existing loss generators and insurance structures.

Example:
    Basic usage for pricing an insurance program::

        from ergodic_insurance.insurance_pricing import InsurancePricer, MarketCycle
        from ergodic_insurance.loss_distributions import ManufacturingLossGenerator

        # Initialize loss generator and pricer
        loss_gen = ManufacturingLossGenerator()
        pricer = InsurancePricer(
            loss_generator=loss_gen,
            loss_ratio=0.70,
            market_cycle=MarketCycle.NORMAL
        )

        # Price an insurance program
        program = InsuranceProgram(layers=[...])
        priced_program = pricer.price_insurance_program(
            program,
            expected_revenue=15_000_000
        )

        # Get total premium
        total_premium = priced_program.calculate_annual_premium()
