I am writing a research paper, and I ran an experiment based on the following simulation:
- `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\run_vol_sim_colab.py` configures each simulation
- `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\ergodicity_vol_sim_parallel.ipynb` orchestrates the parallel runs

I have identified the most interesting results, which I'm thinking of presenting as follows (these are bullet points that need to be fleshed out into a research paper analysis):

* Insurance value compounds over time for all capitalizations and parameters run, compared to no insurance. The value of insurance rises with capitalization from $5M to $25M, as seen in this chart for Asset Turnover Ratio = 1.0 (the same conclusion holds for other Asset Turnover Ratios): `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\output\publication\interesting\year_by_year_growth_lift_facets.png`
* The rest of the analysis is shown for $5M Capitalization and Asset Turnover Ratio of 1.0, but the results are consistent across the modeled range.
* I propose the following three additional charts of interest, which need to be presented in a compelling manner:
    1. `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\output\publication\interesting\volatility_tax_vs_premium_savings.png`
        * This chart shows that, indeed, the expected value growth is higher with higher deductibles due to premium savings, but this reverses drastically due to the Volatility Tax (explain what that is), which erodes value for all scenarios but Guaranteed Cost due to complicated tax reasons (maybe give a brief explanation). The Volatility Tax makes Guaranteed Cost strongly preferable for all configurations considered, but I anticipate this will reverse for bigger companies and for lower operational volatility.
* The remaining charts evaluate Guaranteed Cost scenarios against No Insurance more closely
    2. `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\output\publication\interesting\wealth_fan_chart.png`
        * 37.8% of scenarios without insurance were insolvent by year 50, with median time-to-ruin being 20 years. In contrast, virtually all scenarios survived under all deductibles. This is expected because insurance was unlimited, so catastrophic scenarios were fully absorbed by the carriers.
        * What is noteworthy is the median Guaranteed Cost path significantly outperforms the median path without insurance
    3. `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\output\publication\interesting\insurance_outcome_distribution_basic.png`
        * This chart shows the distribution of Guaranteed Cost outcomes compared to No Insurance. Not shown here is the fact that nearly 38% of scenarios without insurance go bankrupt during the simulation, making them incomparable here. Of the surviving scenarios, 78% of paths end up wealthier with insurance (measured by assets), with mitigated downside for the paths that end up worse off.
* The charts above are generated by `ergodic_insurance\notebooks\results_vol_sim\3. generate_publication_viz.ipynb`
        * What I need you to validate in the charts is why does the chart `insurance_outcome_distribution.png` say "78% of surviving paths end up wealthier with insurance", "85.2% Wealthier at year 50 across all 250K paired simulations", and "37.8% saved from ruin", I would think these 3 numbers should reconcile, with (surviving paths)+(saved from ruin) being close to (all wealthier paths), but that's by far not the case now. Please explain.
